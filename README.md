Game Design

Summary:
	Embark on a perilous journey as Agent K in this endless runner set in a mysterious, dark cave. Your mission: explore the depths of the unmapped cave and uncover the origins of its ominous threats. Collect strange, glowing crystals scattered throughout the cave to temporarily slow time, giving you an edge to dodge deadly robots and unpredictable laser strikes. As danger lurks at every turn, survival depends on your reflexes and wit. How far can you go, and will you unravel the secrets of the cave?

Gameplay:
	The goal of the game was to create an endless runner with a twist. Most endless runners are super one dimensional, with a selected few exceptions. During the 2010s, a splurge of endless runners came onto the scene but 90% of them felt like copies of each other but with a different coat of paint. With O.p Kunin I didn’t want it to be another endless runner. I wanted a twist on the genre, and create something with unique mechanics. That’s why I decided to make a time slowing mechanic and have that be part of my core gameplay loop. 

Mechanics:
Power Bar: On the top left of the screen, there is a bar that fills up when the player collects one of the shining crystals from the cave. As this fills up, there are two abilities the player can use at different fullness. 

At (atleast) Half Full: The player can click ‘E’ to temporarily slow down time, making it easier to dodge any projectiles coming their way. 

At Full Bar: The player unlocks a new ability, allowing the player to click ‘Q’ on any enemies that are highlighted in green (this ability has a limit range, it's your job to figure out what exactly is this range). Clicking ‘Q’ when an enemy is highlighted in green instantly teleports you to their location so you can finish them off with your trusty swords. Be careful, this ability uses your entire bar. It might leave you vulnerable to the lasers. 

	You can also finish off any enemies by getting close enough to them and using your sword. (Getting in a certain range of the enemy will automatically kill them)

	There might be a few special interactions with the time slowing down, and the crystals. (When holding down the ‘e’ ability, you can fill up your bar by collecting one crystal instead of 4)




Settin:
Deep beneath the surface lies an ominous, uncharted cave shrouded in darkness and mystery. The walls glimmer faintly with the light of strange purple, glowing crystals, their purpose as enigmatic as the cave itself. The air hums with an unnatural energy, hinting at the presence of advanced, otherworldly technology. Lasers crack through the void, and rogue robots patrol the shadows, their origins unknown. This cavern is no mere natural formation—it's a treacherous labyrinth filled with danger and secrets waiting to be uncovered.













Development:
Originally, my idea of the game was completely different. It was to combine tetris and the endless runner genre into one and have them smoothly intertwine into one game. As I was trying to flush out the idea, and making a prototype of the game, I realized that the game wasn’t fun or interactive enough. It felt like playing separate games at once and didn’t have the smoothness between them. Even after spending a week and a bit on the game, I realized that I had to scratch the idea and start over. Making a game that I don’t deem fun would make it super challenging to finish as I wouldn’t have enough motivation to continue. 

	I restarted the project and went back to the drawing board, and after hours of researching, I decided on focusing on a time slowing feature that I accidentally discovered when working on my first game idea. My new game was simple: collect something, power up, dodge objects, and survive. It was inspired by “Lol Dodge Game”, but I had to implement that as an endless runner. 

Many difficulties did occur when creating O.p Kunin, as it was my first time working on a game in large and keeping every script, and its methods organized was a challenge. Making clean and scalable code was much harder than I anticipated. It was also my first time working with Unity’s built-in Time.timeScale function which was the backbone of my mechanic. 

Some other difficulties I ran into came from the math and physics aspect of the game. I started to make my own physics system for the 2D objects and was too stubborn to start over and use Unity’s built-in one. I wanted to have complete control over how the movement felt, but  due to that I had to relearn a lot of kinematics, leading to incomplete equations of kinematics and weird behaviors I had to debug.
